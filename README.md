##Descriptive Statistics Project
This project performs a descriptive statistical analysis on a dataset using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The dataset used is "teachingratings.csv," which contains information about teaching ratings, tenure, gender, age, beauty scores, and more.

##Features:
Descriptive Statistics: Compute various descriptive statistics, including mean, median, mode, minimum, and maximum.
Data Visualization: Generate informative visualizations such as a histogram of beauty scores and a bar plot of gender distribution.
Tenure Analysis: Explore tenure counts and percentages by gender, analyze the impact of visible minorities on tenure, and investigate age differences among tenured and untenured professors.
##Report Generation: Save visualizations and analysis results in a PDF report for easy sharing and documentation.
##Usage:
Clone the repository.
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (pandas, numpy, matplotlib).
Run the Descriptive_stats.py script, providing the path to the teachingratings.csv file.
##Instructions:
The script generates a PDF report containing descriptive statistics, visualizations, and analysis results.
Adjust the file paths or modify the script to suit your specific dataset or requirements.
Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance this project for your statistical analysis needs!
